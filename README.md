# Get Sessions for Delhi from CoWin using Public APIs

This script shows all sessions for all districts in Delhi where minimum age limit is 18 and available capacity is >0. The state name is a variable in the script so should be possible to do it for other states as well. 

Right now, it just prints to command line. But it could be modified to have a mail or message notification sent if there are slots available.
