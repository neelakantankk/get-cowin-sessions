# Get Sessions for Delhi from CoWIN using Public APIs

This script shows all sessions for all districts in a state where the minimum age limit is 18 and available capacity is >0. The state name is passed as a command-line argument. If the state name does not match the list of states, the script outputs possible states for the user to decide on.

### Usage
`python3 get_sessions_from_CoWIN.py [state-name]`

Right now, it just prints to command line. But it could be modified to have a mail or message notification sent if there are slots available. 

## Making online registration mandatory for vaccinations against a deadly pandemic is a really exclusionary and, frankly, stupid move. The longer it takes for people to get vaccinated, the longer this pandemic will go on, and the more chance of vaccine-resistance variants popping up.
